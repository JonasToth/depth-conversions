# master-thesis

Repository containing all code and stuff for my master thesis.
For more specific documentation check the `docs/` directory.

## What is this

Goal of this project is to localize depth image in a known 3D model.
This model can either be a laserscan, a reconstructed mesh or a dense
pointcloud.

All the science for that will be written in my master thesis.

## What exactly is this repository

This repository contians the code, both library and application code, to
actually do the localization. It is organized as a library to provide the
primitive operations and driver code that is used to create useful applications
for several aspects of the localization part.

## Contributing

Right now, not so much. As this is part of my master thesis I need to develop
it on my own. Bug Reports are of course always welcome!
