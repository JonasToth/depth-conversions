@section ModernCppParallelTaskProgrammingLibrary Modern C++ Parallel Task Programming Library

Cpp-Taskflow is a fast C++ @em header-only library to help you quickly 
write parallel programs with complex task dependencies.
Cpp-Taskflow is by far faster, more expressive, fewer lines of code, and easier for drop-in integration
than existing parallel task programming libraries such as <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/programming-models/openmp/openmp-tasking/">OpenMP Tasking</a> and Intel <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/tutorial-intel-tbb-flow-graph">Thread Building Block (TBB) FlowGraph</a>.

Cpp-Taskflow is committed to support both academic and industry research projects,
making it reliable and cost-effective for long-term and large-scale developments.

@section HowToInstallCppTaskflow How to Install Cpp-Taskflow?

Cpp-Taskflow is *header-only* and there is no need for installation.
Simply download the source and copy the headers under the @c taskflow subdirectory to your project.

@code{.sh}
~$ git clone https://github.com/cpp-taskflow/cpp-taskflow.git
~$ cd cpp-taskflow/
~$ cp -r taskflow myproject/include/
@endcode

@section ASimpleFirstProgram A Simple First Program

Here is a rather simple program to get you started.

@code{.cpp}
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>  // Cpp-Taskflow is header-only

int main(){
  
  tf::Executor executor;
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;

  auto [A, B, C, D] = taskflow.emplace(
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },               //  task dependency graph
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },               // 
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },               //          +---+          
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; }                //    +---->| B |-----+   
  );                                                 //    |     +---+     |
                                                     //  +---+           +-v-+ 
  A.precede(B);  // A runs before B                  //  | A |           | D | 
  A.precede(C);  // A runs before C                  //  +---+           +-^-+ 
  B.precede(D);  // B runs before D                  //    |     +---+     |    
  C.precede(D);  // C runs before D                  //    +---->| C |-----+    
                                                     //          +---+          
  executor.run(taskflow).wait();

  return 0;
}
@endcode

The program creates four tasks A, B, C, and D.
The dependency constraints force A to run before B and C, and D to run after B and C.
The maximum concurrency is this example is two, where B and C can run at the same time.

@section CompileAndRunYourFirstProgram Compile and Run Your First Program

Cpp-Taskflow is written in C++17 and is built on top of C++ standardized threading libraries.
To compile the above program, you need to tell the compiler
where to find the Cpp-Taskflow header files.
For example, with gcc you need the `-I` option.

@code{.sh}
~$ g++ simple.cpp -I myproject/include/ -std=c++17 -O2 -pthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC 
TaskB 
TaskD
@endcode

The execution order of B and C might differ as they can run concurrently.

@section SupportedCompilers Supported Compilers

To use Cpp-Taskflow, you only need a compiler that supports C++17:

@li GNU C++ Compiler v7.3 with -std=c++17
@li Clang C++ Compiler v6.0 with -std=c++17
@li Microsoft Visual Studio Version 15.7 (MSVC++ 19.14)

Cpp-Taskflow works on Linux, Windows, and OSX.
