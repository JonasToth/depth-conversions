# Nonius

## What is nonius?

Nonius is an open-source framework for benchmarking small snippets of C++ code.
It is very heavily inspired by [Criterion], a similar Haskell-based tool. It
runs your code, measures the time it takes to run, and then performs some
statistical analysis on those measurements.

If you want to learn more about it, check out the [guide].
